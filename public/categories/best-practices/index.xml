      <description>Hello everyone, today we revisit the REST architecture, while comparing it to the gRPC calls.
A microservices framework sometimes looks like a dream, but it can be a nightmare when processing data. Transiting the data with less latency is not enough nowadays. It also needs to easily connect with systems. And not only does the speed matter, but it also needs to scale to fit your computing needs while not bleeding your infrastructure costs.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone, today we will check how to properly value stream your DataOps initiative.
Enhancements on data ingestion made evident the amount of data lost when generating insights. However, without guidance from methodologies like The DataOps Manifesto, some companies are still struggling to blend data pipelines from legacy databases, such as an ADABAS database, with new ones, such as MongoDB or Neo4j.
And it’s always good to point out that these legacy systems aren’t easy to let go of.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone, today I want to revisit what is Identity and Access provisioning lifecycle phases.
With so much data being generated every second, it makes sense that data leakages are one of the biggest nightmares of any data-driven company. These days, we learn fast that weak security policies can be costly. This article will present one of the techniques to maintain your data secured: the identity and access provisioning lifecycle.</description>
