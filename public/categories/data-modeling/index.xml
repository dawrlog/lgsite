      <description>Hey everyone, hope everything is well.
Even the most potent database is still prone to the terrifying error any database system can face: query bottlenecks.
Sometimes the systems that manage our queries can&amp;rsquo;t process in the same way as we do. So our questions return accurate results as a result of extra processing power.
In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll present how Redshift query queues work. We&amp;rsquo;ll also cover how concurrency works at a high level on Redshift.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone, hope everything is well.
A data warehouse aims to make sense of a specific subject over time by analyzing historical data. This system, also called the decision-making support system, can tackle trends as diverse as the percentage of client churn or beer consumption trends within a geographical area.
Incremental loading is one of those crucial issues you need to consider when defining your load pipelines.
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain what incremental loading is and why it&amp;rsquo;s so important.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone, I hope you are doing well!
If youâ€™re familiar with Argo Workflows, you already know that it can drive your CI/CD pipelines, manage your ETL processes, and orchestrate any set of tasks you can imagine for a Kubernetes cluster. But did you know that Argo knows how to archive the results of its workflows to a SQL database, too?
In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show how Argo Workflows archives workflow state into persistent storage using a Postgres database.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone, today I would like to talk about Bigquery, the datawarehouse managed service by Google Cloud. And I would like to explore its datatypes.
Google Cloud Platform has long been the cloud provider of choice for web analytics, with the impressive BigQuery being Google&amp;rsquo;s massively parallel processing (aka MPP) option. MPP databases are very common on Hadoop ecosystems.
BigQuery is very friendly to its users (let&amp;rsquo;s agree that BigQuery is as pleasant as its SQL knowledge), which fosters new users.</description>

One of the significant challenges in handling data comes from the massive amount of data your organization is most likely generating constantly. Having the ability to react quickly and accurately turns into a differential item among competitors.
More and more companies are becoming aware of the need to handle data wisely.
They&amp;rsquo;re looking for ways of getting the most out of their information. And this is probably where they first hear about data warehouses.</description>
