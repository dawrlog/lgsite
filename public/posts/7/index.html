Power BI increases its adoption among the most experienced users each day. Thanks to being a user-friendly tool with various data sources to connect to, it helps analyze distinct data sources within the same console.\nIn this post, I’ll show you how to import your data stored on PostgreSQL with a desktop version of Power BI.\nI’ll start by explaining what Power BI is and what it does. Then I’ll offer an option to spin up a local instance to explore your PostgreSQL data with Power BI.\nI suggest skipping the “Configure your local environment” section if you already have PostgreSQL and Power BI running or are familiar with Vagrant boxes.\nHowever, I encourage you to look at it if you have some spare time. Leveraging Vagrant can be a valuable option to create your proofs of concept smoothly with automation tools.\nOnce we handle the infrastructure, we’ll configure Power BI to connect to your existing PostgreSQL instance, explore some data on your Power BI instance, and transform it before its final load, creating a chart from your newly imported data.\nWhat is Power BI?\nPower BI is a data visualization tool created by Microsoft; it has different versions focused on other use cases. You can try PowerBI for free on Azure, the Microsoft option for public cloud, to interact with your existing services such as the datawarehouse as service Azure Synapse.\nAnother option is to have it installed on your “on-premises services” using an on-premises data gateway.\nAs Power BI grows more mature, it’s naturally increasing in popularity, most of which is thanks to some neat capabilities offered to its users.\nFor example, it’s quick and sweet to load your structured data as the source on Power BI. That lets you understand the trends of your data and have the answers you need faster than you’re used to, making even the most demanding users happy as it’s possible to explore more data sources.\nAnd remember: better data gives better results!\nSo, with that said, if you’re still struggling to consume your data correctly, you would like to audit your data pipelines. You would need to clean your data, which consists of treating all bad aspects for your analysis. As the data format from its source might not be ready for analysis.\nNow that we understand what Power BI is: let’s see it in action. We will dive right into connecting it to PostgreSQL, one of the most used relational databases options.\nConnecting PostgreSQL to Power BI, configure your local environment\nIf you already have a PostgreSQL instance, skip to the next section Create a database connection. For those who don’t have an instance, let’s start by setting one up.\nFirst, download PostgreSQL and Power BI (Windows only). But wait, suppose you’re like me and are not that into having a Windows machine?\nI suggest using Vagrant.\nHaven’t heard of or used Vagrant before? No problem! Take a look at this quick introduction for a good crash course.\nAfter that, or if you’re already familiar with Vagrant, you’re ready to follow these steps:\nFor starters, you’ll need to download Vagrant and the Windows box used as the base image. Once you have Vagrant set up, you can download Power BI Desktop from inside; a VirtualBox client can do the trick. To follow along, download the database that we’ll be using from here. By doing that, you’ll follow along with a local Power BI instance on your machine. Create a database connection\nTo get started, select the Get Data option after opening Power BI; this will open a window where you’ll specify what kind of storage or database your data is stored in. The popup will show all data sources that Power BI can access.\nFor our exercise, we’ll select the PostgreSQL database, as shown below.\nPostgreSQL database option on “Get Data” window\nOnce selected, Power BI will ask you to confirm the username and password the first time you connect to this database. There’s no need to repeat this validation when you log in as the same user within the same server already used.\nJust ensure that the specified PostgreSQL user has the permissions required on the database where your table resides.\nOnce authenticated on the server, you’ll need to specify the server and the database. To do so, it would simply need to add your PowerBI server address, or localhost if you have a local PostgreSQL instance, to access the database where you’ll select your tables. We’ll select the Import option for the Data Connectivity mode since we’ll be transforming some data before using it.\nThe DirectConnect option, as the name suggests, doesn’t create this needed cache; I always recommend using Import instead of DirectQuery. One of the most significant flaws of DirectQuery is that it doesn’t allow data transformation during the load.\nPostgreSQL database gets data screen\nTo keep it short and sweet, leave the advanced options unchanged and click OK.\nPower BI will inform you before continuing in the case where your connection is not encrypted. If you click Cancel, it will stop the import. I encourage you to explore the SQL Statement option more, as it gives more choices to transform your data while loading it.\nYou can find more details and even a working example on this page about native database queries from Microsoft.\nTransform the data while loading it into your datastore\nNow that we have taken care of our connection, it’s time to make it work for us. On the next screen, you can cherry-pick your tables. Once you select it, you’ll have the option to either load it as is or transform it before using it. In this tutorial, I’ll split the first word from the remaining others using the leftmost delimiter; By chosing select transform, and a new window (like the one below), will appear.\nIn the Select or enter delimiter field, leave the remaining options with space delimiter and quote character unchanged. Doing so will transform the string field into two child fields.\nSplit options for data import\nOnce you confirm the change, you will then go back to the previous screen. It will now reflect the changes you applied on the Split Columns screen.\nIt’s good to remember that you can still remove these changes, even after the previous confirmation.\nThese results aren’t final on the data sources used by the dashboards; instead, they’re on temporary components. So, you can still go back if you want to add or change some extra details.\nOnce all your settings are as desired, select the Close \u0026 Apply option to commit your changes, as shown below.\nPreview Get Data after transformation changes.\nCongratulations! You just imported your data from PostgreSQL into Power BI.\nStart your data journey\nToday we scratched the surface of integrating Power BI and PostgreSQL and breaking down how Power BI could enhance your data exploration on PostgreSQL databases thanks to its very user-friendly interface.\nPower BI enables you to interact with the data in its early stages. Why not enrich your data directly from the source replication right? Just remember what your real needs are.\nIt might be hard to have a complete view of your historical data trend analysis.\nHaving said that, a good thing to have in mind is to avoid, or at least restrict when possible, using Power BI on untreated data.\nThe data in its raw state is more for operational purposes. For time-sensitive analytical purposes, you should always choose to use treated information that gives better insights from application data in its raw state.\nNow, go and have fun!\n",

<p>Today I want to discuss one of the dataviz tools that is getting more and more adoption; <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-au/">Power BI</a>. Power BI increases its adoption among the most experienced users each day. Thanks to being a user-friendly tool with various data sources to connect to, it helps analyze distinct data sources within the same console.</p>

<h2 id="h2what-is-power-bih2br-"><h2>What is Power BI?</h2><br /><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#h2what-is-power-bih2br-">#</a></h2>
<p>Power BI is a data visualization tool created by Microsoft; it has different versions focused on other use cases. You can try PowerBI for free on <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca">Azure</a>, the Microsoft option for public cloud, to interact with your existing services such as the datawarehouse as service <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/synapse-analytics/#overview">Azure Synapse</a>.</p>

<p>Haven&rsquo;t heard of or used Vagrant before? No problem! Take a look at this <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/intro">quick introduction</a> for a good crash course.</p>
<p>After that, or if you&rsquo;re already familiar with Vagrant, you&rsquo;re ready to follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>For starters, you&rsquo;ll need to <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads">download Vagrant</a> and the Windows box used as the <a href="https://app.vagrantup.com/gusztavvargadr/boxes/windows-10">base image</a>.</li>
<li>Once you have Vagrant set up, you can <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/">download Power BI Desktop</a> from inside; a <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a> client can do the trick.</li>
<li>To follow along, download the database that we&rsquo;ll be using from <a href="https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/">here</a>. By doing that, you&rsquo;ll follow along with a local Power BI instance on your machine.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h2create-a-database-connectionh2br-"><h2>Create a database connection</h2><br /><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#h2create-a-database-connectionh2br-">#</a></h2>
<p>To get started, select the Get Data option after opening Power BI; this will open a window where you&rsquo;ll specify what kind of storage or database your data is stored in. The popup will show all data sources that Power BI can access.</p>
<p>For our exercise, we&rsquo;ll select the <strong>PostgreSQL database</strong>, as shown below.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/img/posts/PostgreSQL-db-get-data-ui.png" alt="PostgreSQL database option on Get Data window"  />

<em>PostgreSQL database option on &ldquo;Get Data&rdquo; window</em></p>
<p>Once selected, Power BI will ask you to confirm the username and password the first time you connect to this database. There&rsquo;s no need to repeat this validation when you log in as the same user within the same server already used.</p>
<p>Just ensure that the specified PostgreSQL user has the <strong>permissions required</strong> on the database where your table resides.</p>
<p>Once authenticated on the server, you&rsquo;ll need to specify the server and the database. To do so, it would simply need to add your PowerBI server address, or <code>localhost</code> if you have a local PostgreSQL instance, to access the database where you&rsquo;ll select your tables. We&rsquo;ll select the <strong>Import</strong> option for the Data Connectivity mode since we&rsquo;ll be transforming some data before using it.</p>
<p>The <strong>DirectConnect</strong> option, as the name suggests, doesn&rsquo;t create this needed cache; I always recommend using <strong>Import</strong> instead of <strong>DirectQuery</strong>. One of the most significant flaws of DirectQuery is that it doesn&rsquo;t allow data transformation during the load.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78096758/217086916-21252609-df76-48d0-9978-1344de6d8ea3.png" alt="PostgreSQL database gets data screen"  />
</p>
<p><em>PostgreSQL database gets data screen</em></p>
<p>To keep it short and sweet, leave the advanced options unchanged and click OK.</p>
<p>Power BI will inform you before continuing in the case where your connection is not encrypted. If you click <strong>Cancel</strong>, it will stop the import. I encourage you to explore the <strong>SQL Statement</strong> option more, as it gives more choices to transform your data while loading it.</p>
<p>You can find more details and even a working example on this page about <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/native-database-query">native database queries </a> from Microsoft.</p>
<h2 id="h2transform-the-data-while-loading-it-into-your-datastoreh2br-"><h2>Transform the data while loading it into your datastore</h2><br /><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#h2transform-the-data-while-loading-it-into-your-datastoreh2br-">#</a></h2>
<p>Now that we have taken care of our connection, it&rsquo;s time to make it work for us.
On the next screen, you can cherry-pick your tables. Once you select it, you&rsquo;ll have the option to either load it as is or transform it before using it. In this tutorial, I&rsquo;ll split the first word from the remaining others using the leftmost delimiter; By chosing select <strong>transform</strong>, and a new window (like the one below), will appear.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Select or enter delimiter field</strong>, leave the remaining options with <strong>space delimiter</strong> and <strong>quote character</strong> unchanged. Doing so will transform the string field into two child fields.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78096758/217087430-60688d2e-ea51-4bf1-adf0-116381d49622.png" alt="Split options for data import"  />
</p>
<p><em>Split options for data import</em></p>
<p>Once you confirm the change, you will then go back to the previous screen. It will now reflect the changes you applied on the <strong>Split Columns</strong> screen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to remember that you can still remove these changes, even after the previous confirmation.</p>
<p>These results aren&rsquo;t final on the data sources used by the dashboards; instead, they&rsquo;re on temporary components. So, you can still go back if you want to add or change some extra details.</p>
<p>Once all your settings are as desired, select the <strong>Close &amp; Apply</strong> option to commit your changes, as shown below.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78096758/217087847-e6eb4702-1ecc-4426-b3f9-aca84351e968.png" alt="Preview Get Data after transformation changes"  />

<em>Preview <code>Get Data</code> after transformation changes.</em></p>
<p>Congratulations! You just imported your data from PostgreSQL into Power BI.</p>
<h2 id="h2start-your-data-journeyh2br-"><h2>Start your data journey</h2><br /><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#h2start-your-data-journeyh2br-">#</a></h2>
<p>Today we scratched the surface of integrating Power BI and PostgreSQL and breaking down how Power BI could enhance your data exploration on PostgreSQL databases thanks to its very user-friendly interface.</p>
<p>Power BI enables you to interact with the data in its early stages. Why not enrich your data directly from the source replication right? Just remember what your <strong>real needs</strong> are.</p>
<p>It might be hard to have a complete view of your historical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trend_analysis">data trend analysis</a>.</p>
<p>Having said that, a good thing to have in mind is to avoid, or at least restrict when possible, using Power BI on untreated data.</p>
<p>The data in its raw state is more for operational purposes. For time-sensitive analytical purposes, you should always choose to use treated information that gives better insights from application data in its raw state.</p>
<p>Now, go and have fun!</p>
