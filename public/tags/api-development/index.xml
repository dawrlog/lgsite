A microservices framework sometimes looks like a dream, but it can be a nightmare when processing data. Transiting the data with less latency is not enough nowadays.

To help you with that, I want to talk about targeted DDoS attacks and what they do to your application programming interface, also known as API endpoints. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain what DDoS is and the problems it can cause.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone, today I want to revisit what is Identity and Access provisioning lifecycle phases.
With so much data being generated every second, it makes sense that data leakages are one of the biggest nightmares of any data-driven company.
